So stoked to finally announce my creative engineering class has just launched today! Enrollment is now open until Dec 27 at Monthly.com/MarkRober (link also in bio).

This class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.

During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.

The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.

This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.

The class officially starts on January 4, 2021, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested!

See you in class!

Lyrics:

(Uh, check this out
Yeah
Always, always mean what you say
G Herbo)

Real nigga till I leave
Elevated do this rapping shit, with ease
I got a brick on my sleeve
You dissing me, please
Comparing me to different emcees stop it
I‚Äôm really in the shit so I don‚Äôt pop it
Before Twitter was a trending topic
I was on the block with 30 shots and Glocks, had the spot hoppin, dummy
But they act like they don‚Äôt remember that
Been a leader with that heater, I got right up into that
You can‚Äôt never take a killin back
Whole heart was in the streets
I had to leave her get my fucking feelings back
Same spot they shot my brother, next day I‚Äôm chillin at
I ain‚Äôt lyin they was winnin till we started spinning back (spinning back)
But anyway, said enough of that let‚Äôs talk about this paper (talk about it)
Let‚Äôs talk about them jets, yeah let‚Äôs talk about Jamaica
Ask about me I ain‚Äôt never been a fraud (ever)
I went hard from the start (start)
In my city I‚Äôm a God (motherfucker)
If you know, you know
Never been no phony tho (forreal)
Rollie‚Äôs for my brodie though
Barely know joe rodeo
Heard they looking for me, I‚Äôm like oh I‚Äôm on the way
Bond money, no I‚Äôm straight I spent 130 K at the gate
They like swerve stay safe
I‚Äôm like man y‚Äôall late
Yelling ‚Äúfree me‚Äù, I‚Äôm like I‚Äôve been in the crib all day
I‚Äôm in Cali thinking how I come from pissy hallways
Long as I never go back I‚Äôm that nigga, always (always)
And you know that
Been having these Ms
But they taught me not to show that (for what)
Before that like a throwback (like a throwback)
As soon as the shit go left I‚Äôm a throw back (brrrr)
And I could have bought the Rolls last year but instead I bought a 4flat
That‚Äôs no bap (no bap)
Pro Chicago, I‚Äôm pro Raq (pro Raq)
Motivation for the trenches because I‚Äôm pro black (pro black)
Real no limit so we don‚Äôt play by the rules
How the fuck I catch a case, we bought a school (damn)
Don‚Äôt be fooled, you niggas fools (fool ass niggas)
On the gram reading comments I‚Äôm like ‚Äúooh, cool, so they want me to lose‚Äù
I can‚Äôt break like I‚Äôm bulletproof (teflon)
And I can‚Äôt say what I wanna say
All I‚Äôm gonna say is before fame, bitch I been the truth
And when you put it on my name gotta send some proof (dumbass)
They like charge it to the game
I got feelings too
Shit be difficult (yeah), but still visual
Me and JB been talking about residual
Check on my analytics shit, get digital
Yo just stay up off my dick, it ain‚Äôt consensual

This is the Oat & Pecan Brittle Cookies recipe from Dessert Person. This chewy, butterscotchy oat cookie might not be the kind you can casually whip up on a whim. But, if you go through the steps to make it, like making the pecan brittle, grinding the oats, and browning the butter, you will be rewarded with hands-down the most delicious oat cookie you've ever tried. Somewhere between a lacy cookie and a chewy one, it's giant, buttery, and sweet-salty. Make them along with Claire and remember to keep some of the dough frozen so you're never more than 20 minutes away from a perfect warm cookie. Subscribe for more Dessert Person content from Claire!

Following in the steps of his self-titled debut solo album 'McCartney', featuring Paul playing every instrument and writing and recording every song, Paul McCartney releases 'McCartney III.‚Äô Paul hadn‚Äôt planned to release an album in 2020, but in the isolation of ‚ÄúRockdown,‚Äù he soon found himself fleshing out some existing musical sketches and writing even more new ones. 
 
Lyrics ‚Äì 
Verse 1
Well I can find my way
I know my left from right
Because we never close
I‚Äôm open day and night

Verse 2
I know my way around
I walk towards the light
I‚Äôm open round the clock
I don‚Äôt get lost at night

Middle
You never used to be
Afraid of days like these
But now you‚Äôre overwhelmed 
By your anxieties
Let me help you out
Let me be your guide
I can help you reach
The love you feel inside

[Repeat verse 1]

[Repeat middle]

[Repeat verse 2]

[Repeat middle]

I know my way around
I walk towards the light
I‚Äôm open round the clock
I don‚Äôt get lost at night

MY FAVORITE THINGS LYRICS: 
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens 
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens 
Brown paper packages tied up with strings 
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels 
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles 
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings 
These are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes 
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes 
Silver white winters that melt into springs 
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things 
And then I don't feel so bad
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens 
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens 
Brown paper packages tied up with strings 
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels 
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles 
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings 
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things 
And then I don't feel so bad
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things 
And then I don't feel so bad

I have a longer video on this, but I'm posting this for the Shorts Shelf. Plus some people like the bite-sized videos!

If you can't do a pushup, don't let it ruin your day!

Fitness is a journey, and we're all at different places.

Just find a pushup variation that you CAN do safely and competently, and work it until you're able to hit a goal of sets and reps!

Then you can move on to a harder variation.

Here's the progression:

Wall Pushups - 3 sets of 50
Incline Pushups - 3 sets of 40
Kneeling Pushups - 2 sets of 25

That's it! Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to address them!

I'll make a follow-up to this on how to build up to one-arm pushups!

Thanks so much for watching!

Je suis si heureuse d‚Äôavoir pu r√©aliser le r√™ve de ma m√®re. Elle ne s‚Äôen est toujours pas remise‚Ä¶ et moi non plus d‚Äôailleurs ! Tout √ßa c‚Äôest gr√¢ce √† vous les copains, donc merci du fond du c≈ìur. 
Maintenant je compte sur VOUS pour diffuser l‚Äôamour autour de vous en surprenant  vos proches √† votre tour. Vous pouvez fabriquer quelque chose de vos mains  (peindre un tableau, coudre un v√™tement, faire un collier de nouilles‚Ä¶euh peut-√™tre  pas) ou avoir une attention non mat√©rielle (une chanson, une danse, un spectacle‚Ä¶ ). En tout cas, il faut que ce soit quelque chose qui sorte de votre c≈ìur et qu‚Äôon ne  peut pas acheter tout pr√™t en magasin. Pensez √† vous filmer si vous voulez faire partie de  ma vid√©o compilation de vos ≈ìuvres! 
Bonnes f√™tes √† tous ! 

Envoyer vos vid√©os √† cette adresse: Mamancavaetretafete@gmail.com 

Et merci √† toute la merveilleuse √©quipe qui m‚Äôa permis de monter cette √©norme  surprise !

Mark has suffered a couple of bowel obstructions over the years, and just a couple of weeks ago had to go into the hospital for a few nights. I invited my friend Dr. Austin Chiang, a Gastroenterologist, or doctor who specializes in intestinal issues, to join me today and give us some more insight into what Mark was experiencing and to educate us on NG Tubes, bowel movements, and so much more. We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre feeling better, Mark! Congrats on your poop.

What would happen if we were to detonate a very very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon? Would the explosion knock its orbit towards  earth, causing tidal waves and misery? Could the moon be destroyed, showering the earth in a rain of meteoric death?

The Grinch is a Christmas¬†classic in all of it's iterations. From the original to the Carrey to the newest¬†2018 version, the Grinch has found his way into our holiday traditions. In a previous theory I talked about the problems with his heart growing three sizes. Today, I'm here to figure out if the Grinch was RIGHT to be angry at the Whos.

Historically, about 20 percent of vehicle sales would have transacted below $20,000; however, they have completely dried up in the last few years. New cars are becoming more expensive, and it is unlikely those cheap cars will ever be back.

At just 22, he‚Äôs already 20-0 with 17 knockouts, electrifying crowds with his lightning speed and electric energy. But behind that boxer is a young man who fights not just for the roar of the crowd, but fights to ensure the happiness and stable future of those he loves. This is about the sacrifices Ryan must make in the pursuit of a dream, the passion he must harness into mesmerizing discipline, so that he can focus on the most important fight of his life against Olympic Gold medalist Luke Campbell.

REDLINE REBUILDS: We spend hundreds of hours tearing apart old engines, machining and obsessively cleaning the parts, and reassembling it all.

Share the satisfaction of the finish and the first fire-up!

BARN FIND HUNTER: Tom Cotter literally wrote the book(s) on barn finds, starting with The Cobra in the Barn. Tom travels North America in his 1939 Ford Woodie Wagon, searching for forgotten classics in barns, backyards, dusty garages, and scrapyard, and meets the fascinating characters who open the barn doors for him and tell him their stories.

In this show, we follow the money to find out how the cocaine industry actually works, why it functions the way it does, why the brutal tactics of the War on Drugs (designed only to suppress the business) are doomed from the start and needlessly target the most vulnerable across the world. 


In War On Drugs, we examine the social implications of prohibition worldwide. Any attempt to shut down the trade in drugs such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine or weed invariably sets off a chain of events that just makes things worse, leaving a trail of death, illness, violence, slavery, addiction, crime and inequality across the globe.
 
Everyone loses ‚Äì except, in a weird kind of way, the drugs themselves.

But at $550, they also come at a very premium price that‚Äôs way more expensive than competitors like Bose and Sony. Watch our whole review to see if they‚Äôre worth it for you.

When Rob Dahm first saw the Hoonicorn launched in 2014, he knew one thing for sure: he needed that same kind of insane project in his life. Measuring pixel by Instagram pixel, and a few phone calls posing as a Hoonigan employee (thanks, Rob), he went down a path of no return to build the wildest FD RX-7 ever. Four rotors, AWD, a giant turbo, sequential transmission, and a whole lot of learning leads up to this very race: up against the car that inspired him to begin with.

82,DDceqGs8t7k,2020-12-15T17:43:16Z,Eddie Van Halen's Cause Of Death Officially Confirmed,UCWlIGsKGsvgFJHkiZml4O1A,"A little more than two months after the tragic death of Eddie Van Halen, news has finally come of the official cause of the legendary rocker's death. Eddie Van Halen had battled all kinds of cancer for years, and it was originally reported that the guitar god succumbed to lung cancer. Van Halen was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2000, following years of cigarettes and booze ... and guitar picks? He would later say he believed the cancer was caused by the metal in the pick he often held in his mouth. Either way, he had part of his tongue removed in 2002, and he said it was the part that his copper and brass guitar picks always touched.

He was regularly treated for the cancer through the years, but it eventually began to spread even further through his body, including to his lungs. When he died, it was announced that he had lost his battle with cancer. However, according to his death certificate obtained by TMZ, while Eddie definitely did suffer from several debilitating medical conditions ‚Äî including lung and skin cancers, pneumonia, and a disorder affecting the bone marrow called myelodysplastic syndrome ‚Äî the official cause of death was a stroke.

TMZ also reported Eddie's wishes about what should be done with his remains. His body was cremated 22 days after his death, and the ashes were received by his son, Wolfgang. The ""Eruption"" soloist's final wishes stated that his ashes be scattered in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Malibu. Eddie and Wolfgang were very close both on and off stage, so you can bet that Wolfgang will honor his father's final wishes. Wolfgang tweeted the day his father died,

""He was the best father I could ever ask for. Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift. [...] I love you so much, Pop.""

Released on November 16, the first single on Wolfgang's pending first solo album was a tribute to his late father. According to Guitar World, Wolfgang dedicated the song ""Distance"" to Eddie, saying it was one of his father's favorites on the album. Wolfgang said, 

""'Distance' is a song that was initially written for the debut album, but was going to be held for a later time. [...] As my pop continued to struggle with various health issues, I was imagining what my life would be like without him and how terribly I'd miss him. While this song is incredibly personal, I think anyone can relate to the idea of having a profound loss in their own life."" 

He said he hadn't planned on the song being the first solo tune of his that the public would hear, but he decided to release it in honor of his father's legacy. Saying, ""This is for him.""

Eddie said before he passed that the album sounded like, 

""AC/DC meets Van Halen meets aggressive pop. The riffs are catchy. It's a little of everything and sounds like a freight train coming at you. I've never heard anything quite like it. It's so powerful that I'm jealous."" 

Considering the source of the praise, that's quite the compliment. Now the world waits and listens for what else comes from the next generation of the Van Halen legacy.

Lyrics
I‚Äôm at the supermarket
Gon cop some rhubarb
I reach into my pocket
It‚Äôs time to get charged
I pay in cash, and I know what happens next is strange
I flash a stunning smile and say:
‚ÄúYou can keep the change‚Äù
OH!! WHAT
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm a GOOD PERSON
You can have that money (It‚Äôs yours!)
And also coins are uncomfortable in my pockets, uh

Sitting by my computer
Mom comes inside the lair
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs smelling like a sewer
You should go and get some air‚Äù
I‚Äôm gettin up, and stretch, I‚Äôm filling up with pride
I open up the door and put a single foot outside
OH!! WHAT
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm a GOOD PERSON
I leave my house (So healthy!)
I‚Äôm gonna put my foot back inside of my house now, uh

My lifestyle‚Äôs quite unhealthy
I snacked recording this
Got an expanding belly
Can‚Äôt find a shirt that fits
Roll my chair to the kitchen, fill my snack bowl to the brim
Yeah I know that might look bad, but then I sign up for a gym
OH!! WHAT
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm a GOOD PERSON
I‚Äôm a gym member (gon get ripped)
And I will go there sometime, I just haven‚Äôt decided on a date yet, uh

I‚Äôm chilling out in class
My teacher‚Äôs such a jerk
And suddenly he asks
‚ÄúWhere is your homework‚Äù
All my friends in panic, ‚Äúno was that today??‚Äù
I slap mine on the desk and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get an A. Plus.‚Äù
OH!! WHAT
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm a GOOD PERSON
I do my homework (model student!)
Turns out I plagiarized and now I‚Äôm in detention, uh (sad, whiny uh)

My mom is back again
‚ÄúCan you take out the trash?‚Äù
Her mind was blown right then
‚ÄúI did it before you asked‚Äù
OH!! WHAT
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm a GOOD PERSON
I do my chores (For mommy!)
Couldn‚Äôt find a trashcan so I dumped it in the ocean, uh

It‚Äôs just a regular day
OR IS IT, grandma?
No, someone‚Äôs changin age and
it isn‚Äôt grandpa
Other grandsons may just write on facebook walls
But I am grandmas special boy, so I am gonna call
OH, what, oh yeah I‚Äôm a good person
I remember birthdays (for example February 7th!)
You better think of me when you‚Äôre drafting up your will

I‚Äôm hanging out with Quinston
He is the coolest guy
Got 30k on insta
Always wears suit and tie
I tell him ‚Äòbout how good I am, but he says ‚Äúbro, 
The people who are really good don‚Äôt brag about it though‚Äù
what? You‚Äôre saying bragging about the nice things you‚Äôve done misses the whole point of doing nice things in the first place?
Oh! What? Oh yeah, I‚Äôm a good person?
I don‚Äôt brag ever (never did!)
Now please excuse me while I go delete my twitter, uh
(Oh, and I gotta delete this song. What, it‚Äôs already on YouTube and Spotify? Well hopefully no one will listen to it.)",10,7494591,1,465964,False,12771,72589,False

You could hear it from the get-go. When Madison Beer's 'As She Pleases' EP dropped a couple years ago, it immediately started a sizable reaction around the world, placing the name of the new singer on the lips of instant fans and industry tastemakers. A mix of self-assurance, sensuality and terrific songcraft made for a pretty much irresistible package. Beer's moved quickly since then, too. That initial recognition for her indie project has blossomed into a deal with Epic Records, and back at the start of this year, Beer showed her followers further growth with the elaborate sci-fi narrative of her very cool ""Good In Goodbye"" vid, as well as the sizzling lament of her ""Selfish"" vid, both of which she conceived and directed. When ""Baby"" started to clock mega views at the end of the summer, it was pretty easy to predict: this woman is going all the way. Her performances for our LIFT series are as enticing and substantial as the vision she has for her own art. We worked closely with Madison to capture these radiant performances. ""Selfish"" and ""BOYSHIT"" are from her upcoming album, 'Life Support.' As she prowls our stage, she definitely owns it. Stay tuned, there's more coming.¬†¬†

In addition to being nice beyond reason, she is also fun to play pranks on. Five years ago Micki and her husband Eric bought their first house from a woman named Carol who chose them over several other people who made higher offers. As a show of gratitude, Micki invited her to come back and use the house anytime. Many years later Micki still keeps in touch with Carol always inviting her to visit, always welcoming, always thankful. So, Jimmy had some free time over the summer, made a fake email address for Carol, and set in motion what is perhaps the greatest prank he has ever pulled.

SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 meters cubed. An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of SCP 002 possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body.

152,lN5Pk5qbN6E,2020-12-14T16:37:41Z,Pourquoi le FROID nous rend MALADE ? (En √©t√© o√π sont les virus ?),UCA9IJ0GhYcbSst7C6cQWrKw,"‚ÄúMet une √©charpe sinon tu vas tomber malade !‚Äù.  Toutes les mamans du monde ont d√©j√† donn√© ce conseil ! Et √ßa a l‚Äôair vrai. Il suffit de passer une soir√©e dehors sans son manteau, et on se retrouve le lendemain clou√© au lit ! On dit alors qu‚Äôon a ‚Äúattrap√© froid‚Äù ? Une expression qu‚Äôon retrouve dans plein de langues.
Anglais : cold = rhume et froid
Italien : influenza = influence du froid
Russe : —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π (kholodnyy) = rhume et froid
Hindi :  ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä (sardee) = rhume et froid*
Pourtant‚Ä¶. c‚Äôest pas logique ! Le froid ‚Ä¶ c‚Äôest juste du froid. 
Quand vous ouvrez votre frigo, vous ne tombez pas malade. 
Les gla√ßons de votre coca ne sont pas de dangereuses armes bact√©riologiques ! 
Non, comme vous le savez : c‚Äôest les microbes et les virus qui sont les responsables !
Mais du coup, pourquoi r√©apparaissent-ils brusquement en hiver alors qu‚Äôils semblent avoir disparu en √©t√© ?
La statistique le prouve : on tombe 5 fois plus malade en hiver !
Alors, o√π se cachent les virus pendant nos vacances ?
Vous allez voir, la question est beaucoup plus int√©ressante et complexe qu‚Äôelle n‚Äôen a l‚Äôair.

The original Five Nights at Freddy's spawned many sequels and sister games. Over the years I've played them all and through that stumbled upon the phenomena that is FNAF fan games. Games so loved by FNAF fans that those games have ALSO created their own universes - some linked to the original game and some all their own. These games have gotten so big that it's a wonder they haven't been struck down by the copyright powers that be - and there is a VERY specific reason they haven't. You see, Scott Cawthon has learned one thing that most game companies never have and likely never will - community.

WHY DO I CALL MY FANS GREG?
Greg is the strongest family on the internet, we're the fastest growing channel on Youtube, and we make fire content. So, instead of making up some pun using my name and calling my fans that, I decided to use a different name entirely. A name so strong, haters tremble when it is spoken. WE ARE GREG. AND WE ARE TAKING OVER THE INTERNET. And all you have to do to join is hit subscribe and turn on notifications.

176,Pydeb_8RnHw,2020-12-13T16:02:50Z,The Ben Simmons-Donovan Mitchell beef over Rookie of the Year became a feast for fans and brands,UCDRmGMSgrtZkOsh_NQl4_xw,"In April of 2018, Ben Simmons said he‚Äôd ‚Äú100%‚Äù choose himself as rookie of the year. This is a good, normal amount of self-confidence for a player who has been putting up triple-double left and right all season. Nothing wrong with that. Sure, he did then go on to add that no other rookies had done so much as caught his attention that year ... 

Meanwhile Donovan Mitchell was a breakout rookie sensation. For example he won the dunk contest, had multiple games over 40 points, and was leading Utah to the playoffs in the competitive West.  When he heard Simmons' comments, he decided to get his attention‚Äî by wearing a hoodie that questioned Simmon‚Äôs status as a rookie in the first place.

You see, Ben Simmons was drafted in 2016, but was injured all season, so according to NBA rules, he counted as a rookie in 2018. According to Mitchell‚Äôs hoodies, one emblazoned with the dictionary definition of the word ‚Äúrookie‚Äù, one that simply said ‚Äúrookie?‚Äù, Simmons‚Äô status wasn‚Äôt so clear cut.

Both players insisted any and all taunts, digs, or hoodies were lighthearted. So, the media, the shoe companies, and most importantly, the fans took it upon themselves to pump bad blood through that light heart. Leaving us with a beef that took on a life of its own, one in which Simmons and Mitchell were merely avatars representing the two sides.  They might not have really hated each other, but there was still plenty of hate to go around.

Chocolate¬†is one of the most beloved sweets out there. We use it in EVERYTHING from sweet to savory dishes, in many different cultures, and for many occasions.

And if I underestimated anything you did for me, yeah

That love could feel this good
If I could rewind time, then I'll make you mine
You know if I could then I would, yeah-yeah-yeah (woo)
You know I want you back, I want you back (woo)
'Cause who gon' make me feel this way?

I want you back

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, uh

Ooh, yeah, ha, ah

We felt the rush so fast
So fast that we could not last
Felt like someone took my dove (yeah-yeah)
You showed me the true meaning of real love

And if I underestimated anything you did for me, yeah
It's 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know
That love could feel this good
If I could rewind time, then I'll make you mine
You know if I could then I would, yeah-yeah-yeah (woo)
You know I want you back, I want you back (woo)

196,g3trZKhAAcI,2020-12-12T21:35:02Z,Charley Pride ‚Ä¢ Country Music Hall of Fame Member ‚Ä¢ 1934-2020,UCNs2MOu2nXDTxHXHfvPH3Rg,"In the 1960s, Charley Frank Pride became country music‚Äôs first Black superstar, lending his honeyed baritone to songs that captivated audiences, broke racial and cultural barriers, and led him to a place in the Country Music Hall of Fame.

Pride‚Äôs hit-making heyday lasted from 1966 through the 1980s, but his impact is perpetual. A 2020 recipient of the Country Music Association‚Äôs Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, Pride is an inspiration to generations of performers, a model of quiet dignity and artful fortitude.

Raised in the segregated South as the son of a sharecropper, Charley Frank Pride was born on a cotton farm in Sledge, Mississippi, fifty miles south of Memphis. He spent his childhood laboring in fields, playing baseball, and listening to the Grand Ole Opry on a Philco radio. He bought his first guitar when he was fourteen, and began developing a style of singing that would come to impress his heroes.

‚ÄúWhat came from my throat was my voice, no one else‚Äôs,‚Äù he wrote in his autobiography. ‚ÄúNo one had ever told me that whites were supposed to sing one kind of music and blacks another ‚Äî I sang what I liked in the only voice I had.‚Äù

At 16, Pride left Mississippi and played baseball in the Negro American League. He was enamored of Jackie Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball‚Äôs color barrier in 1947.

‚ÄúTo say that he was my idol would be an understatement,‚Äù Pride said. ‚ÄúAs far as I was concerned, Jackie Robinson had rewritten the future.‚Äù

Pride never realized his Major League Baseball dreams, but he rewrote country music‚Äôs future. His gifts as a singer were greater than his athletic prowess. In 1962, country stars Red Sovine and Red Foley heard Pride singing in Helena, Montana, and encouraged him to come to Nashville. A year later, Pride auditioned in Nashville for manager Jack Johnson, and Johnson was astounded.

Johnson introduced Pride to renegade producer Cowboy Jack Clement. On August 16, 1965, Clement took Pride to RCA‚Äôs Nashville studio and recorded demonstration recordings that impressed RCA head man Chet Atkins, who flew to Los Angeles and received approval from the label brass to sign Pride to the label.

Pride‚Äôs first single, ‚ÄúSnakes Crawl at Night,‚Äù was released in January of 1966. Pride‚Äôs race was shielded from country radio disc jockeys until the third single, ‚ÄúJust Between You and Me,‚Äù climbed into the country Top Ten. The cover of his gold-selling first album, Country Charley Pride, was the first time many fans discovered that he was Black.

‚ÄúI get a lot of questions asked me . . . ‚ÄòCharley, how‚Äôd you get into country music and why you don‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre supposed to sound,‚Äô‚Äù Pride said during a 1968 concert at Panther Hall in Fort Worth, Texas. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little unique, I admit. But I‚Äôve been singing country music since I was about five-years-old. This is why I sound like I sound.‚Äù 

Pride responded to discrimination with square-jawed silence, determined that talent would overcome prejudice. His work spoke volumes. He was the CMA‚Äôs Entertainer of the Year in 1971, and he scored twenty-nine #1 country hits, including enduring classics ‚ÄúIs Anybody Goin‚Äô to San Antone,‚Äù ‚ÄúKiss an Angel Good Mornin‚Äô,‚Äù ‚ÄúAll I Have to Offer You Is Me,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMountain of Love.‚Äù He was named the CMA‚Äôs top male vocalist in 1971 and 1972, and was one of RCA‚Äôs top-selling artists for decades.

Pride was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993, seven years before his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. 
At the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum‚Äôs donation ceremony for Jack Clement‚Äôs guitar in 2019 Pride recalled his early recordings. He said that Clement told him, ‚ÄúCharley these songs we‚Äôre recording right now, fifty years from now they‚Äôre gonna be spinnin‚Äô ‚Äòem.‚Äù

It has been more than fifty years, and those songs are still spinning.",10,365798,1,5622,False,64,911,False
