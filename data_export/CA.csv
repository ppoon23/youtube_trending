So stoked to finally announce my creative engineering class has just launched today! Enrollment is now open until Dec 27 at Monthly.com/MarkRober (link also in bio).

This class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.

During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.

The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.

This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.

The class officially starts on January 4, 2021, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested!

See you in class!

The zombies can climb blocks, break blocks and even run way faster than normal! This made the game way harder than normal! This is a custom coded mod by us.

This is the Oat & Pecan Brittle Cookies recipe from Dessert Person. This chewy, butterscotchy oat cookie might not be the kind you can casually whip up on a whim. But, if you go through the steps to make it, like making the pecan brittle, grinding the oats, and browning the butter, you will be rewarded with hands-down the most delicious oat cookie you've ever tried. Somewhere between a lacy cookie and a chewy one, it's giant, buttery, and sweet-salty. Make them along with Claire and remember to keep some of the dough frozen so you're never more than 20 minutes away from a perfect warm cookie. Subscribe for more Dessert Person content from Claire!

Je suis si heureuse d‚Äôavoir pu r√©aliser le r√™ve de ma m√®re. Elle ne s‚Äôen est toujours pas remise‚Ä¶ et moi non plus d‚Äôailleurs ! Tout √ßa c‚Äôest gr√¢ce √† vous les copains, donc merci du fond du c≈ìur. 
Maintenant je compte sur VOUS pour diffuser l‚Äôamour autour de vous en surprenant  vos proches √† votre tour. Vous pouvez fabriquer quelque chose de vos mains  (peindre un tableau, coudre un v√™tement, faire un collier de nouilles‚Ä¶euh peut-√™tre  pas) ou avoir une attention non mat√©rielle (une chanson, une danse, un spectacle‚Ä¶ ). En tout cas, il faut que ce soit quelque chose qui sorte de votre c≈ìur et qu‚Äôon ne  peut pas acheter tout pr√™t en magasin. Pensez √† vous filmer si vous voulez faire partie de  ma vid√©o compilation de vos ≈ìuvres! 
Bonnes f√™tes √† tous ! 

Envoyer vos vid√©os √† cette adresse: Mamancavaetretafete@gmail.com

I have a longer video on this, but I'm posting this for the Shorts Shelf. Plus some people like the bite-sized videos!

If you can't do a pushup, don't let it ruin your day!

Fitness is a journey, and we're all at different places.

Just find a pushup variation that you CAN do safely and competently, and work it until you're able to hit a goal of sets and reps!

Then you can move on to a harder variation.

Here's the progression:

Wall Pushups - 3 sets of 50
Incline Pushups - 3 sets of 40
Kneeling Pushups - 2 sets of 25

That's it! Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to address them!

I'll make a follow-up to this on how to build up to one-arm pushups!

Thanks so much for watching!

Mark has suffered a couple of bowel obstructions over the years, and just a couple of weeks ago had to go into the hospital for a few nights. I invited my friend Dr. Austin Chiang, a Gastroenterologist, or doctor who specializes in intestinal issues, to join me today and give us some more insight into what Mark was experiencing and to educate us on NG Tubes, bowel movements, and so much more. We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre feeling better, Mark! Congrats on your poop.

What would happen if we were to detonate a very very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon? Would the explosion knock its orbit towards  earth, causing tidal waves and misery? Could the moon be destroyed, showering the earth in a rain of meteoric death?

The Grinch is a Christmas¬†classic in all of it's iterations. From the original to the Carrey to the newest¬†2018 version, the Grinch has found his way into our holiday traditions. In a previous theory I talked about the problems with his heart growing three sizes. Today, I'm here to figure out if the Grinch was RIGHT to be angry at the Whos. You see, I think there was a reason we all missed - a medical reason. Get your earmuffs ready, Theorists, we're about to get LOUD!

New cars are becoming more expensive, and it is unlikely those cheap cars will ever be back.

At just 22, he‚Äôs already 20-0 with 17 knockouts, electrifying crowds with his lightning speed and electric energy. But behind that boxer is a young man who fights not just for the roar of the crowd, but fights to ensure the happiness and stable future of those he loves. This is about the sacrifices Ryan must make in the pursuit of a dream, the passion he must harness into mesmerizing discipline, so that he can focus on the most important fight of his life against Olympic Gold medalist Luke Campbell.

REDLINE REBUILDS: We spend hundreds of hours tearing apart old engines, machining and obsessively cleaning the parts, and reassembling it all. We exhaustively chronicle every step along the way with thousands of photos, then boil it down to a fast-paced but incredibly detailed time-lapse video. Share the satisfaction of the finish and the first fire-up!

BARN FIND HUNTER: Tom Cotter literally wrote the book(s) on barn finds, starting with The Cobra in the Barn. Tom travels North America in his 1939 Ford Woodie Wagon, searching for forgotten classics in barns, backyards, dusty garages, and scrapyard, and meets the fascinating characters who open the barn doors for him and tell him their stories.
