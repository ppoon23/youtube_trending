So stoked to finally announce my creative engineering class has just launched today! Enrollment is now open until Dec 27 at Monthly.com/MarkRober (link also in bio).

This class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.

During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.

The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.

This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.

The class officially starts on January 4, 2021, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested!

See you in class!

Lyrics 
FAMILY TIES
FAMILY OF FIVE
DAD LEFT I WENT JAIL
MUM KEPT THE FAMILY INLINE
JUST HER AND THE TWINS
MONEY SO LOW SHE HAD TO CANCEL THE SKY
LATE NIGHT RUNNING OUT OF ELLECY
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT CANDLE FOR LIGHT
ALL I KNOW IS SURVIVAL
I LEARNT THAT FROM KAREN AND LIFE
SAME OLD CYCLE
NANNY WAS RIGHT
I COME FROM WHERE THE MOTHERS ARE WORRIED
SUN COMES UP AND THEY‚ÄôRE SONS ARE HAVEN‚ÄôT COME IN
CANT KEEP FOOD IN MY ROOM CAH I KNOW IF MY MUM FINDS THAT THEN MUMS FLUSH IT 
NOW I OWE THE BIG MAN PS
AND I GOTTA GO COUNTRY FOR NOTHING 
I KNOW THE ROAD TING WELL
I BEEN WHO I SEE THESE YOUNGERS BECOMING
I GOT ONE LITTLE COUSIN WHOS JUST LIKE I WAS 
HES ABOUT 14 NOW AND ITS MAD CAH I ASK MYSELF WHERE THE TIMES GONE
GOTTA LEAD BY EXAMPLE 
SHOW THE YOUT DEM WHAT IM ON
MIC ON
LET BYGONS BE BYGONS
I TOLD YOU IM BLESSED MY GUY
I REPLACED THAT X WITH AN I
THATS WHY THEY CALL ME AN ICON 
BLOODS THICKER THAN-
FRIENDS COME AND GO MOST AIN'T LIFELONG
AND THE ONES THAT ARE BECOME FAMILY
AND THATS MY FAMILY ASIDE FROM 
THE USUAL SUSPECTS 
CANT TAKE NOMORE FUNERALS
YOU SEE THE SUIT BUT DEATH AIN'T A SUITABLE SUBJECT
SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR OUTSIDE MY MUSICAL SUCCESS 

UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
THAT GET THROUGH ANYTHING MIRACLE LOVE
THAT NOTHING CANT TOP THIS PINNACLE LOVE
THAT SPIRITUAL LOVE
THATS THAT ORIGINAL LOVE

OUR FAMILY 
PROUD FAMILY
FROM MY GRANNY TO MY CHILDREN
MUM YOU RAISED A REAL ONE
MY NEPHEW COMING SOON
GOT A COUSIN I AIN'T SPOKEN TO IN YEARS
BUT I STILL GOT LOVE FOR YOU
PROUD

PROUD FAMILY 
PROUD FAMILY
FROM MY GRANNY TO MY CHILDREN
MUM YOU RAISED A REAL ONE
MY NEPHEW COMING SOON
GOT A COUSIN I AIN'T SPOKEN TO IN YEARS
BUT I STILL GOT LOVE FOR YOU

MY SONS ONE AND MY DAUGHTERS EIGHT
IN ALL THAT TIME I AIN'T CAUGHT A CASE
LONG TIME I AIN'T BEEN ACTIVE 
I JUST BEEN MILKING THIS RAP SHIT
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING BOUT CORN AND FLAKE
IF I LET SOMETHING SLIDE
YOU AIN'T WORTH THE 25
THATS FOR MY SON AND MY DAUGHTERS SAKE
I COME FROM WHERE OUR FATHER FIGURES
ARE THE HARDEST NIGGAS
SHOTTERS, ROBBERS
HEARTLESS KILLERS
THIS CANT BE THE IMAGE 
BUT THATS ONLY HALF OF THE PICTURE 
MUM LET HER BOYS GET AWAY WITH MURDER
BUT SHE WAS HARD ON MY SISTER
PARDON MY HISTORY 
FAMILY AFFAIR THEY ALL PART OF MY VICTORY 
I AM NO FATHERLESS INFANT
BUT I WAS BROUGHT UP WITH MY AUNTIES ASSISTANCE 
AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIVE WHERE I GREW UP I STILL CANT KEEP MY DISTANCE 
HOW CAN I LET MY KIDS ONLY EVER SAY FATHER AT CHRISTMAS 
I GOT KIDS RELYING ON ME 
I CANT KEEP THE IRON ON ME
BABE CAN SLEEP ON GHETTS BUT PLEASE STOP LYING ON ME
MY BABYMUM IS A KEEPER I JUST DO WHAT SHE REQUIRES OF ME
THE LAST TIME ME AND JESS SPOKE I SAID DON'T GO DYING ON ME 

UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
THAT GET THROUGH ANYTHING MIRACLE LOVE
THAT NOTHING CANT TOP THIS PINNACLE LOVE
THAT SPIRITUAL LOVE
THATS THAT ORIGINAL LOVE

OUR FAMILY 
PROUD FAMILY
FROM MY GRANNY TO MY CHILDREN
MUM YOU RAISED A REAL ONE
MY NEPHEW COMING SOON
GOT A COUSIN I AIN'T SPOKEN TO IN YEARS
BUT I STILL GOT LOVE FOR YOU

But behind that boxer is a young man who fights not just for the roar of the crowd, but fights to ensure the happiness and stable future of those he loves. This is about the sacrifices Ryan must make in the pursuit of a dream, the passion he must harness into mesmerizing discipline, so that he can focus on the most important fight of his life against Olympic Gold medalist Luke Campbell.

merch n music n stuff http://dodie.co

lyrics:

nobody can go to a party
did somebody hear my song?
devil of two thousand and twenty
i really think you took the message all wrong

yet another vaccine free month
it would be the 10th this year
i think i‚Äôm just gonna say that i‚Äôm sorry
i didn‚Äôt ever think that we would be here

i wear my mask outside
still fragile and tired
oh i, just want a night, worry free
think i am just about to lose it
Probably one more zoom quiz will do it
though i said i think i‚Äôm done with parties that was then,   
i‚Äôll never take a party for granted again

nobody can go to a party
we‚Äôre all just stuck at home
i‚Äôm so fucking sick of my bedroom
oh, i‚Äôd do anything to not be alone

if there‚Äôs one thing this year has taught me
it‚Äôs that there isn‚Äôt much point in a plan,
so when it‚Äôs safe don‚Äôt bother sending an invite, cause
i‚Äôll go to every fuckin party i can 

I just wanna go to a partyyyyy

Mark has suffered a couple of bowel obstructions over the years, and just a couple of weeks ago had to go into the hospital for a few nights.

We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre feeling better, Mark! Congrats on your poop.

The Grinch is a Christmas¬†classic in all of it's iterations. From the original to the Carrey to the newest¬†2018 version, the Grinch has found his way into our holiday traditions. In a previous theory I talked about the problems with his heart growing three sizes. Today, I'm here to figure out if the Grinch was RIGHT to be angry at the Whos. You see, I think there was a reason we all missed - a medical reason. Get your earmuffs ready, Theorists, we're about to get LOUD!

#TheGrinch #Christmas #santa #Grinch

LYRICS:
first off fuck santa claus he eint never done shit for a nigga like me
people been hating on me since I was like three just because I was different and my skin was light green hating and spreading rumors all over IG 
IC them coming for everything that IB
trolling hard and making fun of my teeth, my skin, my hair, and the fucking way I speak was the night before Christmas, all through the house 
I sat in my room alone with no spouse scrolling my phone 
comparing myself to people who don‚Äôt put no food in my mouth
looking around jerking off to bella thornes only fans account
while scheming the system and faking depression so I can get rich just to double my clout i‚Äôm tired of christmas I don‚Äôt want a PRESENT can‚Äôt wait for the FUTURE i‚Äôm done the PAST i‚Äôm fucking up santa on sight if I see him i‚Äôm punching his belly and kicking his ass RUDOLPH can get it that RED on his NOSE a get put on his HEAD if he‚Äôs TALKING that TRASH
DONER and BLITZEN then PRANCER and  VIXEN
and COMET and CUPID and DASHER and DANCE
santa gon‚Äô think i‚Äôm a psycho
i‚Äôm DUNKING these cookies like MICHEAL 
i‚Äôm fucking ms. claus then I‚Äôm posting the vid so your HOE HOE HOE is viral
life is viscous cycle karma comes around and bites you this for everybody who was mean and bullied me down in whoville back in highschool
listen
i‚Äôm NOT UGLY it‚Äôs ACQUIRED TASTE 
My hams greens with the eggs and steak
i MAX out on my DOG I‚Äôm scamming unemployment out in several states
i DRIVE STICK I don‚Äôt need a SLEIGH
need NO HOOKS cause I‚Äôve MASTERED BAIT (masturbate) 
i‚Äôm so good even Santa plays this song on Christmas 
i‚Äôm THE GRINCH
no hands when I‚Äôm taking a piss
no condom when i‚Äôm fucking ya bitch
IN AND OUT like the BURGER i'm SAUCING THE PATTY SO BUNS ON MY DICK A STICK
i don‚Äôt need FIRE to heat to my crib you dumb fuck i‚Äôm already LIT
and the only time you‚Äôll ever RAP better is when you wRAPPING CHRISTMAS GIFTS
i wanna know if you're naughty or nice
i bet you pray on the downfall of others like me whenever you sleep at night
fuck this society everyone acts like they‚Äôre perfect while judging another‚Äôs life you don‚Äôt qualify to judge on what is wrong from right 
YOU‚ÄôRE NOT GOD
OH MY GOD
i‚Äôm bout to THROW massive fit
a PUNCH i don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre a pacifist (pass A fist) I‚Äôll PASS THIS FIST like a perfect STEVE NASH PASS ASSIST 
you straight ASS all you PASS is GAS 
and if you do the math you‚Äôll never be HALF of HALF what my ACTIVE IS 
i‚Äôm CAPtaning you CAP that's a asterisks to say you should never try to be an ACTIVIST 
let me explain my pain and why i‚Äôm going insane
and why ya negativity energy‚Äôs penetrating my brain I gotta fettish for dead ish I‚Äôll JJ REDDISH ya face for speaking PLETHORIC RHETORIC on a veterans name 
don‚Äôt ever speak on my GREEN unless its MONEY i've made 
and if you do it a g g gain ima k k k k k k k k kick in ya face
then take my body builder body run and pick the pace back to my cave up the mountain where I‚Äôll kick up legs 
i know you‚Äôre sick of how I innovate 
santa has been jealous looking for ways to eliminate you can (S)UCK (T)HIS (D)ICK STD if you abbreviate deviate abracadabra you keep on talking you‚Äôll disintegrate I‚Äôm dissing-the-great (dis-in-te-grate) 
chimney sliding milk cookie diving sleigh driving elf and high fiving jolly fat smiling guy that rides private without no license 
G R I N C H I‚Äôm all green not clean spray me with lysol 
i‚Äôm depressed that‚Äôs ok I take drugs to
to pick me up like ground balls
you can tell by my I eyeballs
i self loath so much I might call
1-800-got-junk and tell them I think suicidal and if they don‚Äôt pick up i‚Äôll kill myself and then i‚Äôll go viral and tell God we need a Grinch chapter in next years new age Bible 
then get spiteful, look at earth and see all of my haters living life so seek revival and kill them and all their friends on my arrival... 
And once I arrive you should pray I decide not to come for your neck, do not be cordial and smile in face you‚Äôre a snake And I've heard all the lies that you‚Äôve spread
Do not say sorry or act like you made a mistake and pretend that you want to friends cause now it‚Äôs too late and the words that you‚Äôve said are words that have driven me over the edge
Now I see red
Now I see bullets in unison traveling straight to your head
Now I see people in pain their emotions are withering hanging on just by a thread
You should of left me alone the unknown was the thrill you were searching for but now instead I‚Äôm lyrically piercing your flesh for that thrill and I‚Äôll do it again and again and again
Look in mirror there is no reflection cause you‚Äôre getting sick
You hate on everyone you selfish narcissistic fucking prick
You‚Äôve destroyed me with your words I might just cut off both your lips
And then go trans and cut my shit if it means having you‚Äôll get off my dick...",829909,1,105883,False,1595,11214,False
