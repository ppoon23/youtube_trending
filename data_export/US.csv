So stoked to finally announce my creative engineering class has just launched today! Enrollment is now open until Dec 27 at Monthly.com/MarkRober (link also in bio).

This class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.

During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.

The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.

This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.

The class officially starts on January 4, 2021, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested!

See you in class!

You guys know I lovee dulces, antojitos, chile, todo!!! James had never heard of a Sandia Loca so of course we had to make one and have him try it. We got all the ingredients and dulces that we needed to put it together! There were a few of candies that James hadn't tried so it was perfect!

This is the Oat & Pecan Brittle Cookies recipe from Dessert Person. This chewy, butterscotchy oat cookie might not be the kind you can casually whip up on a whim. But, if you go through the steps to make it, like making the pecan brittle, grinding the oats, and browning the butter, you will be rewarded with hands-down the most delicious oat cookie you've ever tried. Somewhere between a lacy cookie and a chewy one, it's giant, buttery, and sweet-salty. Make them along with Claire and remember to keep some of the dough frozen so you're never more than 20 minutes away from a perfect warm cookie. Subscribe for more Dessert Person content from Claire!

Hosted by Nick Cannon, with panelists Ken Jeong, Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger and Robin Thicke, “The Masked Singer'' is a top-secret singing competition in which celebrities face off against one another while shrouded from head-to-toe in elaborate costumes, concealing their identities. With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. The singers may attempt to throw off the crowd, but keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. Each week, a singer is eliminated -- and then reveals his or her true identity.

The snow first started coming down around 2 p.m. in parts of New Jersey, making its way to the city and beyond thereafter. By 6 p.m., all parts of the tri-state were seeing snow stick to roads and surfaces. Towns in New Jersey already reported a few inches of snow by 6 p.m. — before the worst had even arrived. The storm will intensify over the course of the evening, with the heaviest snow and strong gusts expected to start before 7 p.m.

Winter storm warnings are now in effect for most of the region, including all five boroughs of New York City, through Thursday afternoon. A state of emergency has also gone into effect in New Jersey by order of the governor.",697252,1,3832,False,338,1146,False

The Grinch is a Christmas classic in all of it's iterations. From the original to the Carrey to the newest 2018 version, the Grinch has found his way into our holiday traditions. In a previous theory I talked about the problems with his heart growing three sizes. Today, I'm here to figure out if the Grinch was RIGHT to be angry at the Whos. You see, I think there was a reason we all missed - a medical reason. Get your earmuffs ready, Theorists, we're about to get LOUD!

At just 22, he’s already 20-0 with 17 knockouts, electrifying crowds with his lightning speed and electric energy. But behind that boxer is a young man who fights not just for the roar of the crowd, but fights to ensure the happiness and stable future of those he loves. This is about the sacrifices Ryan must make in the pursuit of a dream, the passion he must harness into mesmerizing discipline, so that he can focus on the most important fight of his life against Olympic Gold medalist Luke Campbell.

In the NFL, speed kills. Even as kids, playgrounds around the world are filled with races just to see who is the fastest. No wonder we obsess over speed. Being the fastest player in the league at any point puts you in a small club of players. But being one of the fastest players in history gets you on today’s list, the fastest players in NFL history.

The film also stars Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Kristen Wiig as The Cheetah, Pedro Pascal as Max Lord, Robin Wright as Antiope, and Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta.
